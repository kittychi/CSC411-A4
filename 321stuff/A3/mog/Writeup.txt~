Part 1

Used mogem(10,num,0.1,0) from 1 to 125 (5x25)

changing Stdev means that we will allow more results to be correct thus changing the log probs (making them smaller). This will allow for a new global minimum due to leaving more room for error.



Shows that the global min is at 6 and going over it makes the log prob suffer. We only need to test at 125 since we are testing every gaussian 25 times.


Part 2

Used mogem(10,num,0.1,0) from 1 to 100 (10x10)

Global min at 8

Since we have more Test cases we needed more gaussians circles to fit them.
given that we were off by +1 for part 1 and we are now off by -2 for part 2, This means that Part 1 had a closer approxiamtion to the actual gaussian where as in Part 2 we used less then was needed meaning that the circles needed to circle every gaussian can be approximated better with less gaussians meaning overlapping testcases. In part 1 we went over meaning that each of the 25 test cases in the 5 gaussians could not be approximated in 5 but needed to use 1 more to approximate it better.
